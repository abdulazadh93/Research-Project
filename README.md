# Research-Project

This project involves in performing scene classification of aerial images of diffrent resolutions. Inception V3 deep tranfer learning network is used to extract the features from the training images, which are optimized and utlized to train the tree-based classifiers. Incpetion V3 has proven to be best for extracting features at diffrent levels from complex images. From the literature study conducted it has been observed that the Tree-based classifiers were less explored in the field of Aerial Scene Classification, which made me focus on utlizing the Decision Tree and Random Forest classifers to perform the scene classification of images. The classifiers were initially trained with the UCMerced dataset, which is the popular dataset commonly used for this purpose, AID dataset is proven to be benchmark dataset which could help to evaluate the robustness of the model, has been further used to train the model and the performance has been evaluated.
